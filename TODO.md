# TODO / Nice-to-Have

## TODO
- Improve prompt to explicitly enforce budget + capacity before purchases.
- Add auto-repair step that scales purchases to fit budget/capacity.
- Add constraint-specific error breakdown in UI (e.g. vegan_only_hours failures).
- Add per-run history aggregation for score trends across time.

## Nice to Have
- Export a single `leaderboard/summary.json` for static hosting.
- Add a small “run all models” script that reads a `models.json` list.
- Add color-coded score bands (A/B/C) in the UI.
- Add “cost per score point” metric in the compare panel.
